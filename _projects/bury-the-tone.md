# Bury the Tone
<br />
In collaboration with Esteban Espinoza, Amani Cavender, and Reece Graham (together as "AGES"), Bury the Tone is my first music release on streaming platforms. It spans a variety of genres, including ambient electronic, black metal, shoegaze, post rock, and math rock.

You can listen to it on your streaming platform of choice below, and if you enjoy the project consider supporting us by purchasing it on Bandcamp for $3.

The EP was recorded at [The Record Co](https://www.therecordco.org/), a non-profit recording studio in Boston. One member of the group was working there part-time, so we were fortunate enough to get free studio time each week, enabling us to write and record in parallel all in the studio. This was a pretty unique experience and ended up shaping the overall style of the record, since we were free to play around with whatever synthesizers, guitar pedals, etc. that they had available in the studio, and incorporate it into the project if we saw fit.

The goal of the project was to explore a variety of genres (many of which I had never worked on before despite being a fan of), and seamlessly interweave and transition between them. While each group member took creative direction on the styles they were most familiar with, the overall vision, writing, and interconnection between styles was a collaborative effort.
