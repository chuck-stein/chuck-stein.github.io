  to: Nov 2023
  description: Coming into my role as the sole Android developer on my team, I was tasked with catching up the Android app to 6 months of iOS work on an intricate new feature. I managed to close this progress gap, through collaboration with another developer who later joined the team, so that both platforms could release simultaneously (in an industry where iOS often comes first). The feature's focus was to provide better physiological insights into strength training workouts. I contributed by architecting and implementing the flows in the app for building and performing a strength training routine. By using the feature for my own workouts while building it, and observing feedback from our testers, I was able to share my own ideas with the team and influence product decisions, an ability I value as an engineer. At WHOOP I also balanced by primary tasks with various projects to improve the codebase as a whole, such as updating our version of Compose, creating a reusable fuzzy search algorithm, building a Retrofit wrapper interface, and developing a generic utility for drawing edge-to-edge UI.

  description: After getting a taste for both mobile development and web development through my prior co-op experiences and personal project Libzy, I decided to focus in on Android development with my first position at WHOOP. On the Growth team I worked on various projects pertaining to membership and promotions, including some full stack projects when we lacked the necessary backend resources. This enhanced my understanding of our software system as a whole, sharpening my perspective as to the bigger picture when developing for a mobile frontend.

  description: As a full stack web developer, I gained experience with a variety of web technologies, including Spring MVC, React, jQuery, CSS, and HTML templating. I contributed to codebases across two different subsidiary websites, and built up my comfort with developing, testing, and maintaining production code. Working for a travel company during the outbreak of a global pandemic was an interesting experience for sure, and a valuable lesson in being able to adapt to change.

  description: I was part of a research team that works on prototyping for potential future product experiences. My primary responsibility was building the first prototypes and demo experiences for an audio augmented reality platform. When I came in the project was just an idea, from which I built a proof-of-concept desktop demo using MaxMSP, showcased the demo to stakeholders to build enthusiasm and support for the project, then fleshed out the proof-of-concept into three iOS demo apps. To evaluate the performance of each prototype along the way, I developed a simple Android app for measuring audio latency. The team and I also explored a stripped-down embedded demo to run directly on the hardware. I traveled to a conference to showcase the technology to developer partners and prepared demo kits of the prototype hardware to distribute to interested partners.
