  description: I was part of a research team that works on prototyping for potential future product experiences. My primary responsibility was building the first prototypes and demo experiences for a patent-pending audio augmented reality technology, as I was the lead developer on the project. When I came in the project was just an idea, which I then built into a proof-of-concept desktop demo using MaxMSP, showcased it to stakeholders to build enthusiasm and support for the project, then fleshed out the proof-of-concept into three iOS demo apps. To evaluate the performance of each prototype along the way, I developed a simple Android app for measuring audio latency. The team and I also explored a stripped-down embedded demo to run directly on the hardware. I traveled to a conference to showcase the technology to developer partners and prepared demo kits of the prototype hardware to distribute to interested partners. I also underwent Lean Six Sigma training, earning Yellow Belt Certification, for which my project entailed directing new project management techniques to my team.

  description: I worked on several important projects for the Growth team, going beyond my role as an Android Engineer to also provide back-end work where needed. This enhanced my understanding of our software system as a whole, sharpening my perspective as to the bigger picture when developing for the Android app. My projects included the full-stack work for A/B testing a new promotion between users, detecting the eligibility for different users to upgrade their hardware and prompting them to do so, and modifying the registration flow to ensure we have proper credit card information stored in Stripe for various types of users. Along the way for every project, I made an effort to eliminate tech debt, improve our infrastructure, and update code to user newer best practices and technologies
