# **About Me**

Hi, I'm **{{ site.author.name }}**. I grew up in **Arlington, Massachusetts**, where I developed a keen interest in **music and technology**. As I learned to produce electronic music and program, these passions developed further, leading me to studying **Computer Science & Music Technology** at **Northeastern University** in Boston. Throughout my time at Northeastern, I explored a variety of types of software development through my several full-time co-op work experiences. After graduating in May 2022,
I am returning to **WHOOP** (where I had my third co-op), as a full-time **Android Engineer**, while continuing to pursue my passion of producing music.
