# **About Me**

Hi, I'm **{{ site.author.name }}**. I grew up in **Arlington, Massachusetts**, where I developed a keen interest in **music and technology**. As I learned to produce electronic music and program, these passions developed further, and now I am finishing up my final year studying **Computer Science & Music Technology** at **Northeastern University** in Boston. I have explored a variety of types of software development through my co-op experiences these past few years at Northeastern. After graduating, I will be returning to **WHOOP**, where I had my third co-op, as a full-time **Android Engineer**, while continuing to pursue my passion of producing music.
