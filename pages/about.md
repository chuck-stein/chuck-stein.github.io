# **About Me**

Hi, I'm **{{ site.author.name }}**. I grew up in **Arlington, Massachusetts**, where I developed a keen interest in **music and technology**.
After learning to produce electronic music and write code, I decided to explore these passions further by studying **Computer Science & Music Technology** at **Northeastern University** in Boston.
Throughout my time at Northeastern, I explored a variety of software engineering roles through my several full-time co-op work experiences.
After graduating in May 2022, I returned to **WHOOP** (where I had my third co-op), as a full-time **Android Engineer**, while continuing to pursue my passion of producing music.
