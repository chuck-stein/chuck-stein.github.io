# **About Me**

I grew up in Arlington, Massachusetts, where I developed a keen interest in music and technology.
After learning to produce electronic music and write code, I decided to explore these interests further by studying Computer Science & Music Technology at Northeastern University in Boston.
During my time at Northeastern, I explored a variety of software engineering roles through my several full-time co-op work experiences.
After graduating in May 2022, I started working in the software industry as an Android Engineer, while continuing to pursue my passion for music through my band [Spider Water](https://spider-water.com/) among other projects.
